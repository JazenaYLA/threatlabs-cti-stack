# Project Story & Timeline

This document chronicles the timeline of our **ThreatLabs CTI** project, detailing the orchestration, challenges, and integration of various security tools.

## Timeline

### 📅 Feb 19, 2026: Environment Isolation & Stabilization
- **Action Runner**: Isolate runner environments. Implemented branch-aware logic to separate Production (/opt/stacks) from Development (/opt/cti-dev).
- **Stability**: Disabled automatic production deployments to prevent destructive synchronization and unnecessary restarts.
- **Restoration**: Successfully restored full stack health across MISP, TheHive, and XTM after deep database/volume recovery.
- **Documentation**: Finalized Wiki and root documentation to capture technical lessons on permissions and healthchecks.

### 📅 Feb 15, 2026: Wazuh Deployment & Standardization
- **Wazuh Stack**: Deployed Wazuh for SIEM/XDR capabilities. Addressed certificate generation and port mapping issues.
- **Standardization**: Standardized `.env.example` naming across all stacks to ensure consistency.
- **Documentation**: Initiated this Wiki to track the project story and timeline, inspired by similar open-source security projects.

### 📅 Feb 14, 2026: Lacus & MISP Improvements
- **Lacus**: Fixed build issues related to Playwright browser downloads and Redis connectivity.
- **MISP**: Resolved HTTPS redirect issues by making the nginx configuration aware of custom ports.

### 📅 Feb 11, 2026: Vaultwarden & Cortex
- **Vaultwarden**: Deployed Vaultwarden for password management, integrated with Traefik.
- **Cortex**: Debugged and resolved a restart loop caused by Elasticsearch connection and indexing issues.

### 📅 Feb 09, 2026: Automation & Refinements
